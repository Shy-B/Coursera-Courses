## Course Description

The Open Source Software Development, Linux and Git Specialization will give you a strong foundation for working comfortably and productively in open source development communities. By completing the Specialization, you’ll have a better understanding of the Linux environment, as well as methods and tools required to successfully use it, and you’ll know how to use Git, the distributed version control system.

### Applied Learning Project
In all The Linux Foundation courses (in any format) we put a heavy emphasis on learning by doing, and aim for a 50/50 balance between lecture and working on lab exercises. Courses 2, 3 and 4 include numerous lab exercises that give you the opportunity to work in a Linux environment, using the methods and tools presented in lectures.
